# Hospital_Length_of_Stay_Analysis
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing hospital operations, patient outcomes, and facility performance using a cleaned Kaggle dataset. Features include LOS trends, discharge outcomes, and health condition insights to support data-driven decisions.

# Project Overview
Objective: To build an interactive dashboard that provides insights into hospital operations, including patient outcomes, length of stay, and facility performance.
# Key Components:
Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python (Jupyter Notebook).
Dashboard creation in Power BI to visualize trends and insights.
Analytical insights to aid hospital administrators in improving patient care and resource allocation.
# Key Features
Dashboard Highlights:

KPIs: Average LOS, Total Patients, Total Discharges.
Monthly Trends: Patient discharges and average LOS.
Facility Comparison: Average LOS across hospital facilities.
Health Condition Analysis: Treemap visualization by condition.

#Page 2: Patient Outcomes and Insights
KPIs: Total Readmissions, Critical Cases.
Gender-Wise LOS Comparison.
Facility Discharge Analysis: Home vs. Expired outcomes.
Detailed Raw Data Table.
# Data Pipeline:

Dataset Source: Kaggle hospital records (100,000 rows, 31 columns).
Preprocessed using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy).
Cleaned data uploaded into Power BI for dashboard creation.
# Tools & Technologies:

Jupyter Notebook (Python) for preprocessing and EDA.
Power BI for visual analytics and dashboard creation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn for initial data visualization.
# Value to Stakeholders
Enables hospital administrators to:
Identify underperforming facilities.
Optimize treatment protocols for conditions with high LOS.
Address resource bottlenecks in high-expired-rate facilities.
